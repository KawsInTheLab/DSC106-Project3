# DSC106-Project3

Creating a github page for our DSC106 Project 3 visualizations.


We decided to pursue an interactive visual that displays the happiness ranking of different countries across the world. We decided to do this because people often see rankings of countries’ data without understanding the global context. Certain geographical areas might have higher happiness levels, which could point to factors such as climate and hours of sunshine having influence over the happiness score.


##Visualization Design
We decided that the most effective visualization for answering this question would be one that implements a map so that the viewer can make comparisons between countries based on their geographical context. We decided to create an interactive globe where the countries are colored based on their happiness index. We created a legend so that the viewer can easily understand what the color/shading of the country represents.

##Interaction Techniques
We decided to use panning and zooming to allow the viewer to easily zoom into specific countries, and move between different parts of the globe. We also added tooltips so that the viewer and gain additional understanding of the country’s statistics, such as the name, and how much of the happiness index is explained GDP per capita, life expectancy, or freedom to make choices. Adding this information allows the viewer to more comprehensively understand the factors behind a country’s happiness ranking.
